# AL Hasib ChatGPT

## Purpose
This file provides an initial overview of the project, setup instructions, and other important information.

## About The Project
This is a chat application designed to integrate with OpenAI's GPT model. Users can send messages and receive a streaming response.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Install Necessary Packages:**
    To run this project, you need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or if you use yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
    This will install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. Key dependencies include:
    * `react`
    * `react-dom`
    * `@types/react`
    * `@types/react-dom`
    * `typescript`

2.  **Start the Development Server:**
    After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or for yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically start the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized in a modular way:
-   `public/`: Contains static assets and the main `index.html` file.
-   `src/`: Contains the source code.
    -   `components/`: Reusable UI components. The `Chat` component is located here.
    -   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks, such as `useHandleStreamResponse`.
    -   `services/`: Functions for API calls and other external services.
    -   `App.tsx`: The main application component.
    -   `index.tsx`: The entry point for the React application.
-   `package.json`: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
-   `tsconfig.json`: Configuration for the TypeScript compiler.
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders that should not be tracked by the Git repository.

## Important Notes
-   The `src/hooks/useHandleStreamResponse.ts` file contains a basic streaming response handler. You may need to enhance it based on your specific requirements.
-   The API call is made in the `src/services/api.ts` file. The endpoint `/integrations/chat-gpt/conversationgpt4` used here is a sample and needs to be configured according to your own backend implementation.
-   Styling is primarily done using inline styles and a global style block within the `Chat.tsx` file.
